Creating and doing variables.
ldc (create new variable)
ldcw_2 (create new double variable)
istore(save int variable)
iload(load int variable)
iconst_0 (false)
iconst_1 (true) (basically just int tho).

iinc (load + saves variable, increase with set value) (2, 1). 


Calculations:
iadd (add 2 variables)
isub (substract)
imul (multiply)
idiv 
irem (get remainder)

(these all all work with doubles, then you get dadd for example, or dsub or dmul)


conversions:
i2d (integer to double)


Jumps
(To create a point to jump to just type name without whitespace) startLoop

ifeq (name) (if value is zero, jump to point. Else don't).
goto (name) (Jump to end)





>= if_icmpge (Can be useful to switch around though, depending on usecase)
> if_icmpgt
<< if_icmple
< if_icmplt
